// Like Java, you must declare variable types and use semicolons.
int i = 10;
char *last = "Hello World!";

//Unlike Java, Strings don't really "exist" in C, you are forced to use char pointers.
printf("%s", last);

//On the topic of pointers, think of them as pretty much the same as arrays in Java.
